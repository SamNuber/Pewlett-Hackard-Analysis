# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of the project was to create SQL Queries to manipulate the given data to create specified tables. These tables were requested to help prepare the manager for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age.
These tables show:
  - The number of retiring employees by title
  - The employees eligible for the Mentorship Program
## Project Results
As expected, the majority of employees reaching retirement age are those in Senior positions. Roughly 60,000 of the 90,000 total employees reaching retirement age currently hold Senior positions. Secondly, there are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.
